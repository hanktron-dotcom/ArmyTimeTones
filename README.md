This code is a fully automated schedule-based audio playback system designed to play traditional bugle tones at specific times of the day. It uses MATLAB's robust datetime functionality to check the current system time in real-time and triggers the corresponding bugle call audio files. The system is set to repeat daily, ensuring the bugle calls play consistently at their designated times.

Key features of the code include:

Customizable Schedule: Easily modify the schedule to include additional bugle calls or adjust playback times.
Automated Rescheduling: Once a bugle call is played, its schedule is automatically updated for the next day.
Real-Time Monitoring: Continuously checks the system clock to ensure precise audio playback.
Error Handling: Built-in debugging messages and exception handling ensure smooth operation and easy troubleshooting.
This project is ideal for applications that require structured audio reminders, ceremonial cues, or a traditional bugle schedule. Whether for personal use or as a demonstration of MATLABâ€™s capabilities, this code is a reliable and adaptable solution.
